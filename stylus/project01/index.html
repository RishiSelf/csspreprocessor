                            CSS is itself a good language for web designing but stylesheets are becoming more complex, 
                            larger, and even harder to maintain. That’s where a preprocessor like Sass comes in action 
                            and helps us to use features which don’t even exist in CSS. The calc() function is a function 
                            that takes a single expression as its parameter and taking the expression’s value as the result. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The expression can be any simple expression including the basic arithmetic operators like addition, 
                            subtraction, multiplication and division.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The only place we can use calc() function is in values and also for a part of some property.
                            The calc() CSS function allows us to perform calculations while specifying the CSS property values like <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer>.
                            
                            The calc() function is defined in the CSS spec since the mathematical expression of calc() conflicts with the Sass’s arithmetic.
